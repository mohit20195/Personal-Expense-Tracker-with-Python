📊 Personal Expense Tracker (Python Project)

🔹 A command-line based Personal Expense Tracker built using Python to help users record, manage, and analyze daily expenses efficiently.

This project allows users to add expenses, view expense history, set budgets, and track spending, making it ideal for beginners learning Python fundamentals like functions, file handling, and control flow.

🧠 Problem Statement

This project provides a simple CLI-based solution to track expenses, categorize them, and monitor spending against a set budget.

🎯 Features

✅ Add daily expenses with date, category, amount & description
✅ View all recorded expenses
✅ Store expenses persistently using file handling
✅ Set a monthly budget
✅ Track total expenses vs budget
✅ Interactive menu-driven interface
